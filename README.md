# Random-selective-block-encryption-technique-for-image-cryptography
Dynamic random growth technique and a hybrid chaotic map which is proposed in this paper are used to perform block-based image encryption. 

The plaintext attack can easily crack the cat map, as it is periodic, and therefore cat map securely used in which it can eliminate the cyclical occurrence and withstand the plaintext attackâ€™s effect. 

The diffusion process calculates the intermediate parameters according to the image block. 

For the generation of the random data stream in the chaotic map, we use an intermediate parameter as an initial parameter. 

In this way, the generated data stream depends on the plain text image that can withstand the attack on plain text. 

The experimental results of this process prove that the proposed dynamic random growth technique and a hybrid chaotic map for image encryption is a secured one in which it can be used in secured image transmission systems.
